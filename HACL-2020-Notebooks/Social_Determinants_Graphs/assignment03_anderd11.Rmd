**NOTE:** Follow an outline format; use bullets to express individual points. 

* RCS ID: anderd11
* Project Name: COVIDMINDER
* Summary of work since last week 

    * Met with Sarah to discuss future work
    * TRIED to run old code before making changes - having issues
    
* Summary of github commits 

    * None thus far
    
## Personal Contribution	

* Researched policy on COVID testing for states with unexpected testing-mortality pattern

## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

* Discuss primary findings: 

    * Why do some states have low testing with low mortality (expected correlation  to be low testing with high mortality)
    * Looked into state COVID testing protocols (ex state of Kansas, which only tests 2% of the state each month, with no found specifications on who is tested)
    * (NOTE: numbers were updated from previous observations) none of the states have the expected correlation of low testing with high mortality
        * several states that actually have done more tests than the National average show the highest mortality rates
	
* **Required:** Provide illustrating figures and/or tables
