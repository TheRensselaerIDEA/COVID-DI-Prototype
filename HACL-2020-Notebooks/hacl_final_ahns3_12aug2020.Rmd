### Guide to linking to external resources (DELETE BEFORE SUBMISSION)

1. How to link to knitted notebooks (ie HTML) files

* For files merged with the master on github, it's possible to provide a direct link in your notebook using the following pattern:

    * Preface: `https://htmlpreview.github.io/? `
    * Repo and branch: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/master/ `
    * Directory and file: `HACL-2020-Notebooks/status_notebook_template.html'

* Example for projects on the public github (COVIDMINDER, COVID Twitter):

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/master/HACL-2020-Notebooks/status_notebook_template.html
