## Overview & Problems Tackled
I used the MortalityMinder app to investigate the causes of midlife mortality in the American Southwest region, specifically in Sierra County, New Mexico. I summarized the results of my finding in the paper “Investigating Social Determinants of Premature Mortality in the United States”. I worked to bring this paper into JAMIA format.

## Data Description
All of the data I used came from the MortalityMinder app, which is simply a visualization tool for the mortality rates by county as reported by the CDC. MortalityMinder uses k-means clustering to partition each county into a risk group for each respective cause of midlife death. The risk groups are low, medium, and high. The causes of midlife mortality that are considered are deaths of despair, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all causes.

## Results
Since the problem I was adressing in my reasearch was crafting use cases for the MortalityMinder app, to be used in the results secion of the paper, I will adress the use cases I researched below.

## Sierra County, New Mexico: health care provider
Sierra County, New Mexico is one of the worst effected places in the country, experiencing extremely high rates of midlife mortality. The rates of all cause, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and deaths of despair are all way above the national averages. 

Sierra County is the single high risk county in New Mexico, and the vast majority of counties in NM experience the highest rates of premature mortality in the country.

Since MortalityMinder is a data visualization tool for health care researchers, providers, payers, and policy makers, I narrowed down the scope of the use case to only the utility it could provide to health care providers in this local.

The leading factors associated with all causes of midlife mortality are children in poverty, free lunch, socio-economic status, mentally unhealthy days, fair or poor health, physically unhealthy days, single parent households, frequent mental distress, frequent physical distress, and income ratio.

From the point of view of a health care provider, this information may be useful to understand what efforts would most positively impact the community.

For example, factors such as fair or poor health and physically unhealthy days are destructive determinants of mortality. Therefore, increasing access to physical activities (like offering yoga classes or swimming lessons at the local hospital) may be something that would have an impact on the midlife mortality rates.

## New Mexico: policy maker
New Mexico, as a whole, is one of the worst places in the country when it comes to premature midlife death.

The mortality rate due to deaths of despair has increased 53.3% from 2000 to 2017, and the rate due to all causes of midlife death increased 25.6%.

Interestingly, the rates of deaths due to cancer and cardiovascular disease decreased in the same time period.

From the point of view of a state level policy maker, it would seem that addressing deaths due to despair would be a priority.

The leading factors associated with deaths of despair are single parent households, low birthweight, violent crime rate, female, mental health provider rate, socio-economic status, and other primary care rate.

While factors such as “female” cannot be addressed at the policy level, other factors such as mental health provider rate and primary care rate easily can and should be.

Access to mental health and primary care physicians should be an urgent concern to policy makers. One suggestion I have is to institute wage compensation for professionals in these fields who are willing to relocate to NM. 

## Summary and Recommendations
I think that the story of midlife mortality in New Mexico, especially deaths of despair, is a compelling one.

Not only that, but looking at how MortalityMinder can be used to understand the factors leading to premature death is crucial to addressing the problem.

While I have briefly gone over what I found and the main take aways of my contributions to the paper, I think that this aspect of the results is an important one.

Other aspects of the analysis include looking at the factors between states of similar population sizes, and national trends in deaths of despair.

One recommendation that I have for the application of MortalityMinder in the future is an inclusion of “deaths due to COVID” as a cause of premature midlife death. This would be in MortalityMinder (not CovidMinder) and include the same k-means clustering and analysis of social determinants using Kendell correlation value.

These features already exist in CovidMinder, but I’m simply recommending that they are also included in MortalityMinder since I’m willing to bet that Coronavirus will continue to be a killer for the next couple years.
