## Personal Contribution	

  * This week I synthesized my research from previous weeks into a concise story for each proposed use case. For Sierra County, I added the relevant images from the MortalityMinder app that were illustrative of my point. I did the same thing for the New Mexico proposed use case. I also outlined in a comprehensive script what I wanted to say, since I didn’t want to mischaracterize my findings inadvertently. I did “outside” research to contextualize what I had discovered, and included quotes from an opinion piece and a press release that supported the proposed utility of the MortalityMinder app and the findings I had made using it. I presented my work on Tuesday and received feedback.

## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

* Discuss primary findings: 

    * This week my aim was to see if what I have been researching is worthy of a use case that had a problem, insight, and solution. I broke down everything I had learned in this manner. For instance, the point of view I was considering (policy maker and health care provider) lent itself to my consideration of the problems they would be concerned with and also the scope of the potential solution. I then added in relevant information from the MortalityMinder app. I found that the insight I had gleamed, and the proposed solutions, were supported by an opinion piece and a press release that I found.
