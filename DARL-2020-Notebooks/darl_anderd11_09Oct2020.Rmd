## Weekly Work Summary	

* RCS ID: anderd11
* Project Name: COVIDMINDER
* Summary of work since last week 

    * began process for cleaning up charts within State Determinants Visualizations for COVIDMINDER
    * reran State_Determinants_Visualization.Rmd to see which states have incorretly labeld features or include features that aren't required to analyze social factors that impact COVID-19 patients
    * tired to add code (details below), but it doesn't produce anything so I only have a screenshot attached until I can get it running
    

## Personal Contribution	

* sorted through code to see which features need to be removed from charts: I reviewed the features that appear on the charts for each state's MRR of Interested Variable graph; some are redundant, others are raw numbers but we need the rates to better evaluate the impact each feature may have
* used excel chart to note which features need to be updated or removed

* attempted adding several lines of code to remove redundant attributes, but I need help determining why it isn't working

## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

* Discuss primary findings: 

    * longitude and latitude are not exactly needed features, since we have the state names as indicator of location
    * many features repeat and show up in chart (i.e. # uninsured and % uninsured), which is redundant
    * Idaho image not loading for some reason
    * it works out nicely that for some states (like Arizona) only some of the # features show up as opposed to the rate - there is less to fix for these, but for states like Florida, a lot more needs to be redone
